# Bookmark Management System - Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for building a multi-component bookmark management system. The system consists of a self-hosted backend server, browser extensions, web dashboard, and mobile applications, all designed to provide a unified bookmark management experience across devices.

## üéØ Project Vision

Create a privacy-focused, self-hosted bookmark management system that allows users to:
- Save and organize bookmarks from any device
- Search across their entire bookmark collection
